  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  Built an end-to-end machine learning system to estimate demand for dockless bike-share from censored usage data, spanning data cleaning, model training, and an interactive demand visualization application deployed online. The resulting demand estimates were used to optimize bike placement and designed to inform local Providence, RI transportation policy discussions around equitable distribution.<br><br>
