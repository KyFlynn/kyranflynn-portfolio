**Overview** — I built a solver that iteratively constructed greedy solutions and then disturbed them to solve large-scale vehicle routing problems. The solver leveraged a simple proxy of local surface information to avoid getting stuck in local minima, and was top-performing in the class competition in both speed and solution quality.

**Setting** — Brown [Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/).

**Github** — [vrp-local-search](https://github.com/KyFlynn/vrp-local-search).

**Language** — Java.

**Tech Stack** — [IBM CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio).
