  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  I built an end-to-end experimental system to study decision-making in healthcare settings where multiple treatment option combinations must be evaluated under limited data. The motivation was to address a common limitation of standard reinforcement learning approaches, which struggle to scale and learn reliably when the number of possible interventions grows.<br><br>
<p>To do this, I designed and implemented reinforcement learning models that explicitly learn the relationships between interventions and system states, representing those dependencies as graphs and using graph neural networks to estimate intervention-level value functions. I supported this work with a full experimental pipeline for synthetic data generation, model training, and performance evaluation.<br><br></p>
<p>The result was a reusable experimental framework that makes complex multi-intervention decision problems tractable to study, enabling systematic evaluation of how structured representations can improve learning behavior in high-dimensional decision settings with limited data.</p>

  <h2>Highlights</h2>
  <p>Developed model architectures, synthetic problems, and testing framework from scratch</p>
  <p>Each intervention (sub-action) and state variable is represented as a node in a bipartite graph</p>
  <p>A graph neural network (GNN) propagates information between state and sub-action nodes to estimate Q-values jointly</p>
  <p>The combinatorial optimization step for selecting the best intervention set is solved via Gurobi using the learned Q-value function</p>
  <p>This approach enables scalable training and decision-making in environments with large binary sub-action spaces</p>
  <p>Integrated GNN message passing into a custom Q-learning loop for multi-action reinforcement learning.</p>
  <p>Designed a modular PyTorch Geometric training pipeline with Gurobi-based optimization for policy selection. </p>
  <p>Demonstrated improved learning stability and faster convergence on synthetic multi-intervention testbeds.</p>
  <p>Applied causal inference tools from the PyWhy framework to improve interpretability of learned dependencies.</p>
